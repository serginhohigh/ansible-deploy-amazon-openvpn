# Deploy multiple openvpn instances via ansible

Hi, this is an educational project, but this does not mean that it is not a working one. If you want, you can use it as a whole or separately.  

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to provide access for employees from a remote branch office of a company  to the local network of the head office company. Since the company's resources were limited, it was decided to place an access point in Amazon hosting provider.
