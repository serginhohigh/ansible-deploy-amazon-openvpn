# Strongswan configuration for two proxy instances

In this case, these are just templates that will not work without a strongswan configuration on the other side. Example I'll throw a little later:pensive:  
But if you understand strgonswan ipsec, itâ€™s easy for you to use these templates and configure at least AWS ec2 side. All you need is to change the following lines in [openvpn-proxy01.ipsec.conf](openvpn-proxy01.ipsec.conf),[openvpn-proxy02.ipsec.conf](openvpn-proxy02.ipsec.conf), [openvpn-proxy01.ipsec.secrets](openvpn-proxy01.ipsec.secrets) and [openvpn-proxy02.ipsec.secrets](openvpn-proxy02.ipsec.secrets) configuration files:
- 'YOUR LOCAL PRIVATE IP'
- 'YOUR LOCAL SUBNET'
- 'YOUR REMOTE TARGET PUBLIC IP'
- 'YOUR REMOTE SUBNET'
- 'YOUR PSK KEY'
